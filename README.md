# SmartShower

This is an android application I developed for a final engineering project. 

The project is designing a smart shower that allows users to digitally control their shower via digital hardware control or via this smartphone application. 

This app enhances the feature set of the smart shower by allowing the user to create user presets, getting data based setting recommendations, use advanced shower features as well as obtaining statistics and insights on their shower usage.
